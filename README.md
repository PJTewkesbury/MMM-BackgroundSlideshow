# Module: Plex Favorites Slideshow

Show a slideshow of images in the background. Great for a photo frame from instead of a mirror, using photos marked as 'favorite' from your PLEX Server.

The `MMM-PlexSlideshow` module is designed to display images fullscreen, one at a time on a fixed interval, from your PLEX server. These images can be shown in order or at random. The images can transition from one to the other and be shown with no edge (cover) or the enter image(contain).

Based on <a href="https://github.com/AdamMoses-GitHub/MMM-ImageSlideshow/blob/master/MMM-ImageSlideshow.js">MMM-ImageSlideshow</a>.

## Dependencies / Requirements

This module requires that you have an accessable PLEX media server where your photos are stored, and that you have marked some of these photoes as favourites (The Heart icon).

## Operation

This module will take in a list of directory paths, one or more, containing image files. The module will display those images in either alphabetical or random order, across either each path one at time or across all the paths at once. Once all the images have been shown, it will loop back and start again.

Extra configurations include setting the amount of time an image is shown for, selecting which file extensions are valid, the transition speed from one image to another, the background sizing, whether or not to animate the transition from one to the other, the gradient used to make the text more readable, and the gradient opacity.
